Fixed
- Large numbers are not type-casted from string to double with a lot of precision
  e.g., '12345678901234567890' gives '12345678901234567168'
- Expression '9 9' returns 9 instead of error.
- Strings cannot have a null character in the middle
- NaN and infinity pop up in the console
- Imprecise results with very small/very large numbers
-
- Windows environment doesn't have header unistd.h
- Factorials may be non-integers or negative
- '3 . 4' weird occurrence of 'adjacent operands' error
- '(1) 7' returns 1 not error.
- Seg faults (accessing memory without permission)
  - caused by passing local variables, etc.
- Unknown characters keep popping up in the error message that includes user input expression
  e.g., 'asdf;aosuhdif;oa' returns error message with: 'ï¿½'
